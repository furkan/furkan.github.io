Hello! I am a developer with experience in
* Python (flask, fastapi, pytorch, pandas)
* Containerization technologies (docker, docker compose)
* CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
* AWS (EC2, ECR, Lambda, DynamoDB, Lightsail)
* Bash
* Linux terminals
* Some frontend (React, Vue)

In addition to my professional experience, I have a personal interest in functional programming concepts, some of which are immutable data structures, determinist functions, and lazy evaluation. I find these ideas fascinating and try to incorporate them into my work where they're applicable.

As a side project, I developed [kjbot](https://furkan.github.io/projects/korsanjaime/) in 2019, a Telegram bot that tracks debts between housemates. This was a fun project that allowed me to apply my programming skills to a practical problem. Since then, I tried to update the bot's codebase and introduce technologies that I learned as an always-learning developer.

I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in my field, and I take pride in my ability to develop innovative solutions to complex problems. Feel free to check out the other pages.
