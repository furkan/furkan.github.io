Hello! I am a Software Engineer with experience in
* Backend (REST APIs, Web Scraping)
* Frontend (React, React Native, Expo)
* Data (SQL, Pandas, Supabase)
* ML (YOLO, AI Agents, Pytorch)
* Devops (Docker & Compose, GitHub Actions, Reverse Proxy)
* AWS (EC2, ECR, Lambda, DynamoDB, Lightsail) / Cloudflare Workers / Some GCP
* Bash / Linux terminals / Some CUDA

\*Some: Not an expert, but have enough knowledge and interest to have a conversation

I also have experience leading international, cross-functional teams and managing relations with B2B clients and partners.

Have a look at my personal [projects](https://furkan.github.io/projects), or check out my [CV](https://github.com/furkan/cv/blob/main/output/CV.pdf).

I enjoy writing songs and designing / creating digital games. Personal aspirations for the near future: improving at German and picking up scuba diving.

I'm always looking for chances to challenge myself and deliver value. Feel free to reach out.
